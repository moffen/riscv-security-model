=== Security Objectives

The security objectives are high-level essential security features for a platform to implement, for the product to be secure and trustworthy. Note that depending on the final use case, some or all of these goals may not be required and that this will be defined in the mapping to platform specifications (TBD - point to the mapping section later).
