== Side Channels 

=== Software Induced

Software-induced side-channel attacks (easier to exploit, because they donâ€™t require any physical access)

Timing side-channel attacks, including cache-timing attacks

Transient execution side-channel attacks (some use cache timing, but not all)


=== Physical 

Physical side-channel attacks (harder to exploit, because they require direct physical access or proximity)

Power analysis side-channel attacks, including Simple Power Analysis (SPA), Differential Power Analysis (DPA), and Correlation Power Analysis (CPA)

Electromagnetic (EM) side-channel attacks, including Simple Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) and Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA)

Fault injection side-channel attacks, including voltage glitching, clock pin tampering, EM disturbances, and laser glitching
